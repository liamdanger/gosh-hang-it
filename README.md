# Gosh Hang It!

Gosh Hang It is a simple polyfill for the [`hanging-punctuation`](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/h/hanging-punctuation/) CSS property, which exists in the spec but is not supported by any major browser.

Here is an [example](http://liamdanger.github.io/gosh-hang-it)!

## Usage
Gosh Hang It has one dependency, and that's `polyfill.js`. It's included in the repo! All you have to do is:

1. Add `polyfill.js` and `gosh-hang-it.js` to your HTML
2. Apply the CSS property `hanging-punctuation: first;` to your stylesheets liberally
3. Rejoice :balloon:
